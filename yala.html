                <h1>Yala National Park</h1>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Yala National Park is the most visited and second largest national park in Sri Lanka, bordering the
                    Indian Ocean. The park consists of five blocks, three of which are now open to the public. There are
                    also two adjoining parks, Kumana National Park or 'Yala East' and Lunugamvehera National Park. The
                    blocks have individual names, such as Palatupana (Block 1). It is situated in the southeastern
                    region of the country, in the Southern Province and Uva Province. The park covers 979 square
                    kilometres (378 sq mi) and is located about 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Colombo. Yala was
                    designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, along with Wilpattu, designated in 1938, as the first
                    two designated national parks in Sri Lanka. The park is best known for its variety of wildlife and
                    is important conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan leopards and aquatic birds. There are
                    six national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. Among the largest is
                    Lunugamvehera National Park. The park is situated in the dry semi-arid climatic region and rain is
                    received mainly during the northeast monsoon. Yala hosts a variety of ecosystems ranging from moist
                    monsoon forests to freshwater and marine wetlands. It is one of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs)
                    in Sri Lanka. Yala harbors 215 bird species including six endemic species of Sri Lanka. The number
                    of mammals that has been recorded from the park is 44, and it has one of the highest leopard
                    densities in the world. The area around Yala has hosted several ancient civilizations. Two important
                    Buddhist pilgrim sites, Sithulpahuwa and Magul Vihara, are situated within the park. The 2004 Indian
                    Ocean tsunami caused severe damage on the Yala National Park and 250 people died in its vicinity.
                    The number of visitors has been on the rise since 2009, after the security situation in the park
                    improved.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In 1560 Spanish cartographer Cipriano Sanchez noted Yala in his map "is abandoned for 300 years due
                    to insalubrious conditions."[1] Chief Justice Sir Alexander Johnston wrote a detailed account on
                    Yala in 1806 after travelling from Trincomalee to Hambantota. On March 23, 1900, the government
                    proclaimed Yala and Wilpattu reserves under the Forest Ordinance.[2] Initially the extent of the
                    reserve was 389 square kilometres (150 sq mi) between the Menik and Kumbukkan Rivers. At that time
                    the reserve did not bear the name Yala. The Game Protection Society (now the Wildlife and Nature
                    Protection Society) was instrumental in establishing the reserve. The forest area between Palatupana
                    and Yala was declared a hunting site reserved only for the resident sportsmen.[2] Henry Engelbrecht
                    was appointed as the first park warden.</p>
                <p>On 1 March 1938, Yala became a national park when the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance was passed
                    into law by D. S. Senanayake, the minister of agriculture. The park consists of five blocks.[3]
                    Subsequently, four other blocks were incorporated to the park. There are six national parks and
                    three wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. Kumana National Park, Yala Strict Nature Reserve
                    and Kataragama, Katagamuwa, and Nimalawa sanctuaries are continuous with the park.</p>

                <h2>Accommodation</h2>
                <p>There are several accommodation options available near Yala National Park, ranging from
                    budget-friendly guesthouses to luxury resorts. Many of these accommodations offer guided tours of
                    the park, as well as other activities such as cookery classes, archery, photography lessons,
                    birdwatching, and nature walks. Some of the most popular accommodations include the Cinnamon Wild
                    Yala, Jetwing Yala, and Leopard Trails.</p>

                <h2>Cultural importance</h2>
                <p>Yala had been a center of past civilisations.[9] King Ravana, the mythical Hindu anti-hero is
                    believed to have established his kingdom here with Ravana Kotte, now submerged in the sea, as its
                    boundary.[citation needed] Seafaring traders brought Indo-Aryan civilisation with them, as Yala is
                    situated in their trading route. A large number of ancient although disrepaired tanks are the
                    evidence of a rich hydraulic and agricultural civilisation dating back to 5th century BC.[3]
                    Situlpahuwa, which was the index for 12,000 arahants, is situated within the park area along with
                    Magul Vihara, which built in 87 BC and Akasa Chaitiya, which constructed in 2nd century BC.
                    Agriculture flourished in area during the period of Ruhuna Kingdom. According to Mahavamsa, the
                    Kingdom of Ruhuna began to decline by the end of the 13th century AD. During the colonial period
                    Yala became a popular hunting ground. Yala is annually visited by 400,000 pilgrims.</p>

                <h2>Tourism</h2>
                <p>The Yala National Park is the most visited park in Sri Lanka.[3] In 2002 around 156,867 tourists
                    visited the park. Foreigners, especially Europeans, account for 30% of total visitors.[16] Block I
                    is the main area for visits. Block III (main gate in Galge area, on Buttala-Kataragama Road) and the
                    adjoining Kumana Park or 'Yala East' (main gate at Okanda, on the east coast not far from Pottuvil)
                    however are becoming popular in their own right too.</p>
                <p>The Situlpahuwa pilgrimage site, geographically in Block III, has kind of an 'enclave'
                    status and is accessible FOC through separate roads from Tissa and Kataragama. Most of the visitors
                    stated that reasons for their visit is to see wild animals, and elephant is the most preferred
                    animal. The visitors like to see bears, leopards, birds as well. In 2000 the income from visitors
                    including lodge fees was approximately US$468,629. Due to security conditions revenue was
                    lost. The Yala National Park has been susceptible to terrorist attacks. On 17 October 2007 a
                    group of LTTE cadres attacked an army detachment in Thalgasmankada in the park. The attack
                    killed six army soldiers and another was caught up in a landmine explosion. On 11 July 2008 four
                    people died in an attack launched by the LTTE. The cadres opened fire at a bus carrying pilgrims
                    to Kataragama. Since the end of the civil war, May 2009, no violence has occurred in Yala area also
                    and it is fully safe for visitors; this was also the main factor in opening blocks III and V for
                    tourists.</p>
