                <h2>Threats to Sri Lankan Leopards:</h2>
                <h3>Threat 1: Habitat Loss</h3>
                <img src="images/1_jK4FNl_MqwRE0woEMr6wBA.png" alt="Habitat Loss">
                <p class="anih">Habitat loss is one of the biggest threats to Sri Lankan Leopards. As human populations grow and
                    expand
                    into natural areas, the leopards' habitat is destroyed or fragmented. This can lead to a loss of
                    prey,
                    as well as increased conflict between humans and leopards. The consequences of habitat loss can be
                    devastating for the leopard population, as it can lead to a decline in numbers and genetic
                    diversity.
                </p>

                <p class="anih">Several mechanisms are being taken to reduce the threat of habitat loss. One such mechanism is the
                    creation of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves. These areas are designed
                    to
                    preserve the natural habitat of the leopard and other wildlife. Additionally, conservation
                    organizations
                    are working to educate local communities about the importance of preserving natural habitats and
                    reducing human-wildlife conflict.</p>

                <h3>Threat 2: Poaching</h3>
                <img src="images/Paiute_Deadfall_Trap.JPG" alt="Poaching">
                <p class="anih">Poaching is another major threat to Sri Lankan Leopards. Leopards are hunted for their fur, which is
                    used
                    in traditional medicine and clothing. Additionally, leopards are sometimes killed by farmers who
                    view
                    them as a threat to their livestock. The consequences of poaching can be devastating for the leopard
                    population, as it can lead to a decline in numbers and genetic diversity.</p>

                <p class="anih">Several mechanisms are being taken to reduce the threat of poaching. One such mechanism is the
                    creation
                    of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves. These areas are designed to
                    preserve
                    the natural habitat of the leopard and other wildlife. Additionally, conservation organizations are
                    working to educate local communities about the importance of preserving natural habitats and
                    reducing
                    human-wildlife conflict.</p>

                <h2>Measures taken to reduce poaching and habitat loss</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>There are several mechanisms that have been implemented to reduce habitat loss and poaching
                        related
                        to Sri Lankan leopards. The long-term conservation of the leopard involves protection,
                        education,
                        conflict mitigation, responsible custodianship, and coexistence1. Here are some of the
                        mechanisms
                        that have been implemented:
                    </li>
                    <li><b>LEOPOCON</b> is a non-profit organization that aims to conserve the Sri Lankan Leopard and
                        secure
                        its future in the country’s various landscapes. They utilize human resources and methods for
                        awareness-raising, education, and research to safeguard the country’s apex predator. They act as
                        a
                        bridge between responsible people in society and necessary authorities to pass on valuable
                        information and throughout the last year, many successful raids conducted by the authorities,
                        creating a barricade between dealers and racketeers while protecting leopards through acts of
                        law.
                        They have also carried out local researches regarding leopards in Sri Lanka. Apart from that,
                        they
                        have been playing a major role in raising awareness in society about the conservation of both
                        leopards and the environment as a whole. They have used digital and printed media, community
                        awareness sessions, and public lectures for this. They have also reached out to many partner
                        organizations and helped them by providing necessary information as well2.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Wilderness & Wildlife Conservation Trust aims to conserve the Sri Lankan leopard in its
                        natural
                        habitat and by doing so, influence larger biodiversity and landscape conservation on this
                        island.
                        They conduct long-term research of the leopard and understand its land-use to achieve their
                        goal1.
                    </li>
                    <li>Camera traps have been installed in various locations throughout the country to monitor the
                        leopard
                        population and to identify individual leopards. This has helped to estimate the population size
                        and
                        to identify areas where leopards are most active3.
                    </li>
                    <li>Awareness-raising campaigns have been conducted to educate the public about the importance of
                        conserving the Sri Lankan leopard and its habitat. These campaigns have been conducted through
                        digital and printed media, community awareness sessions, and public lectures2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Law enforcement has been strengthened to prevent poaching and illegal trade of Sri Lankan
                        leopards.
                        Many successful raids have been conducted by the authorities, creating a barricade between
                        dealers
                        and racketeers while protecting leopards through acts of law
