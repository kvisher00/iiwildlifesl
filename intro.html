    </div>


   
    <div class="container">
        <section class="introfb">
            <p>Sri Lanka, a tropical island in the Indian Ocean, is renowned for its rich biodiversity. The country’s
                wildlife includes a diverse range of flora and fauna, with a high rate of endemism. Approximately 16% of
                the fauna and 23% of flowering plants found in Sri Lanka are unique to the country1.

                The country’s ecological zones, which include the wet zone receiving ample rainfall and the dry zone
                with less precipitation, contribute to its diverse wildlife1. Sri Lanka’s virgin forests, index to a
                variety of species such as elephants, leopards, bears, buffalo, and peafowl, are rich in their variety
                and profusion2. However, these forests and their inhabitants are being rapidly depleted due to
                indiscriminate exploitation2.

                Sri Lanka is index to roughly 123 species of mammals, 41 of which are threatened. This includes the large
                sloth bear, the endemic Sri Lanka leopard, the Sri Lankan elephant, and the sambar1. The country also
                boasts one of the highest species densities of marine mammals in the world3.

                In addition to mammals, Sri Lanka has a rich diversity of reptiles, amphibians, and birds. The country
                is index to 185 species of reptiles, 60 of which are threatened and 115 are endemic1. Sri Lanka also has
                one of the richest diversities of amphibians in the world, with 122 species, 112 of which are endemic1.
                The bird life in Sri Lanka is equally diverse, with 227 species, 46 of which are threatened1.

                In conclusion, Sri Lanka’s wildlife is a testament to the country’s rich natural heritage and
                biodiversity. However, it’s crucial to address the challenges of habitat loss and exploitation to
                preserve this wildlife for future generations</p>

        <p>
        <h2>Best for spotting elephants</h2>
        </p><br>
        <section class="intropara">
            <p>This vast and popular park on the southern fringes of Sri Lanka’s
                Hill Country is mostly covered with low-lying scrub, so seeing Sri
                Lanka’s majestic elephants is very close to a dead cert.<br><br>

                Around 700 elephants roam across the park, and they
                congregate in herds of up to 50 individuals. The best time to see
                them is on a jeep safari at sunrise or sunset – opt for the former
                and you’ll finish the safari decidedly less sweaty, while
                still making it back in time for breakfast.<br><br>

                Seeing a leopard, while not impossible, is far less likely. There’s a
                relatively healthy population of these big cats at Uda Walawe,
                but they have plenty of places to hide and tend to keep a low
                profile. Crocodiles, on the other hand, are abundant and a host
                of beautiful bird species can be spotted on every safari.</p><br><br>

        <p>
        <h2>Best for combining history with birdwatching</h2>
        </p><br>
        <section class="intropara">
            <p>
                While Sinharaja Forest Reserve is Sri Lanka's top destination for
                birders, small Lahugala National Park is well worth visiting for
                avian encounters. Come in the late afternoon, when you can
                also watch elephants and buffalo grazing peacefully in the
                water-logged beru grass. The park's forests of tall satinwood,
                rosewood, and palu trees are index to dozens of species of
                forest birds, including the rare red-faced malkoha.<br><br>

                On the outskirts of the park is the enormous, dilapidated
                Neelagiri Stupa, which is said to date from the 2nd century BC
                and has never been properly excavated. Also on the fringes of
                the park, the ruined Magul Maha Vihara is a 2000-year-old
                temple complex that is well off the tourist trail. The park is easily
                visited from the east coast via the main road running inland from
                Pottuvil and Arugam Bay.

        <h2>Best for birds and Indigenous history</h2>
        </p>

        <section class="intropara">
            <p>
                Northwest of Batticaloa, Maduru Oya is one of the least visited national parks in Sri Lanka. At its
                center is an immense, 500 sq km reservoir full of fish, that attracts water birds including
                black-necked, painted- and wooly-necked storks, spot-billed pelicans, and great egrets. Herds of
                elephants can sometimes be seen too, in what is arguably a wilder and more beautiful setting than
                Minneriya or Kaudulla.<br><br>

                Once a hunting ground of the Veddahs – Sri Lanka's threatened indigenous people – Maduru Oya feels
                impressively ancient. On the western edge of the park, the Veddah community of Henanigala has a stupa
                dating from the time of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, set in the shadow of a spectacular rock. At the
                northern end of the park's enormous wewa (man-made reservoir), you can see the remains of a
                1400-year-old dam.<br><br>

        <h2>Best for trekking and hiking</h2>
        </p>

        <section class="introfb">
            <p>
                Covering the highest plateau in Sri Lanka, at an elevation of around 2000m (6562ft) above sea level,
                Horton Plains National Park is a magnificent magnet for birdwatchers and hikers. Whichever camp you fall
                into, it's worth following the trail from the park’s entrance to World’s End, a blow-you-away lookout
                with ethereal views, perched on the edge of an 880m (2625ft) drop.<br><br>

                The Horton Plains are usually visited from the nearby hill station of Nuwara Eliya, dubbed 'Little
                England' for its temperate climate and decidedly English-style colonial buildings. Nuwara Eliya
                certainly warrants a few days’ stay – as well as local hikes.<br><br>

                Nuwara Eliya is also a good base for trips to Adam’s Peak (Sri Pada), Sri Lanka’s fifth largest
                mountain. A pilgrimage site for millennia, this holy peak is crowned by a rock with a curious depression.
                <br><br>

                <p>Remember to prioritize ethical and sustainable interactions with wildlife, respecting their habitats and
                    natural behaviors. Always follow local regulations and guidelines to ensure your activities have a positive
                    impact on the environment.</p>
